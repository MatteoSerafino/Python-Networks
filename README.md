# Python-Networks
Introduction to Network on Python

These slides are meant both to give a short overview to Complex Networks on Python
and to guide beginners users to the basic steeps are needed when someone is dealing
with a network.

This is done in two different parts:
1)part_1_Networks_and_Python.ipynb
2)part_2_Networks_and_Python.ipynb

In the first part we go trouhg the basic operations  can be perfrmed on a network,
as for example computign P(K) (degree distribution), C(k) (clustering coefficient),
L (average shot path) or comparing different scaling hypotesis.

In the second part we compute some centrality measures (as for example the betweenness centrality)
on one of the most famous netowrk of the field: the Zachary's karate club. 
We  continue by giving an insight on community detection and we conclude showing how
it is possible to export the analyzed network to other tools, as for example Gephi.


These slides can not be used as a complete introduction to Networks on Python.
They can not be thought of as a compressive guide of the ibraries used in the notebooks.

As I said ad the beginning, they are just a short overview, wich should give to the reader 
a sense of what can be done with Networks using python.
