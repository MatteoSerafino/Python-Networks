Introduction to Networks on Python

These is a short overview of Complex Networks on Python and a guide for 
beginners users to the basic steeps are needed when someone is dealing
with a network. This is done in two different parts:

1)part_1_Networks_and_Python.ipynb
2)part_2_Networks_and_Python.ipynb

In the first part, we go through the basic operations that can be performed on a network,
as for example computing P(K) (degree distribution), C(k) (clustering coefficient),
L (average shot path) or comparing different scaling hypotheses.

In the second part, we compute some centrality measures (as for example the betweenness centrality)
on one of the most famous networks of the field: the Zachary's karate club. 
We  continue by giving an insight on community detection and we conclude by showing how
it is possible to export the analyzed network to other tools, as for example Gephi.


These Notebooks can not be used as a complete introduction to Networks on Python.
They can not be thought of as a compressive guide of the libraries used in the notebooks.

They are just a short overview, which should give to the reader a sense of what
can be done with Networks using python.

These Jupyter Notebooks were used in March 1, 2021 during the class of Complex-Network at the CCNY:
Lecture 3: Introduction to Python for Network Analysis and Visualization
